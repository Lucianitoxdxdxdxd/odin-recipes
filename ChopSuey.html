<h3>The recipe that I bring you today is a chicken Chop Suey. They can not add any type of meat, or try seitan, or some other lean meat. You'll see that we marinate the chicken in the recipe for a little while, you can do it with whatever you use!</h3>

<h3>Chop Suey is what the words “mixed chunks” sound like in Cantonese. They are combinations of sautéed vegetables with different types of meat. Over time, the Chop Suey recipe has been modified and improved, there are a lot of variations, but what they all have in common are onion, carrot and bean sprouts. The latter is one of the main ones! It gives it a great touch. They say that Chop Suey comes from the Cantonese dish Sap Kam, which means "ten precious things" and contains noodles, mushrooms and other things. Anyway, it doesn't matter where exactly it comes from... This dish became an emblem of Chinese food outside its borders for a good reason: it's great. Do you dare to try it?</h3>
